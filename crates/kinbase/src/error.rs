//! Closed error taxonomy from `spec/cli.md` "Error contract".
//!
//! Every failure that leaves a command is a `ContractError` carrying the five
//! documented fields. The exit code is a pure function of the code so no call
//! site can pair a code with a foreign exit. Codes outside the closed table
//! cannot be constructed: `ContractError::new` maps an unknown code to the
//! internal-failure code and records the defect in the message.

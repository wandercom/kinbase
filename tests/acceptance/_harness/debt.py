"""The instrument's own outstanding-validity ledger.

Detector Reviewer dispatch 003 found 22 blocking defects. Twenty-one are closed
by causal rework: the entries below record what each finding was and what
replaced it, so a later reviewer can check the repair rather than take it on
trust.

One entry remains open. It is not engineering work: it needs a named human
rightsholder to sign a rights grant, which the Tester must not fabricate.

An instrument with known validity debt must not report green.
``spec/verification.md`` "Instrument validity" makes an instrument that cannot
substantiate its own controls ``INVALID_HARNESS``, and "Verdict semantics"
forbids an unperformed measurement from becoming proof. So the open entry is
enumerated here, machine readable and content addressed, it forces its gate's
instrument channel to ``INVALID_HARNESS`` at census construction, and the suite
*fails* while it remains open.

This is deliberately not a suppression list. Nothing here is skipped, xfailed or
tolerated.
